Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly in relapse as the attempted coup provides Erdogan with his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

Control is dangerously addictive to the intellectually impotent not only because it artificially raises his otherwise low confidence but also because he mistakes it for genuine power. The former footballer now president of Turkey is so foolishly drunk with authority and disdainful of freedom that he constructed the world's largest palace on the grounds of Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo, a deliberate and lame insult. Such a fusion of power and ignorance effectively turns a presidency into a therapy.

Erdogan is now purging the country of anyone who could take the slightest amount of power away from his puny hands, starting with the greatest guardians of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers: 103 generals and admirals. The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

At this point, it is important to understand that in Turkey where Erdogan ends democracy begins and that each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the coffin of Atatürk's heritance.

Turkey has already seen a sharp decline of its freedom of expression, some media outlets have been taken over by the government, others have been raided, social networks are either heavily censored or blocked in their entirety. Combine this trend with the annihilation of the opposition and genuine support for the government and you depict a rather grim future for Turkey and Eurasia. 

This is the start of what was. 

It makes me sick into in my own scorn to see secular democratic states taking the side of the totalitarian religious and abandoning the real victims of this tragedy, the moderate Turks. On four occassions the Turkish army has estimated necessary to overthrow the government in order to safeguard democracy and this last attempt was one of them. 






If the conflict between state religion and democracy is not evident it soon will be. While secular states are not always democratic, religious states ultimately lead to totalitarianism (religion is by definition total and is not compatible with individual liberty). Founders of modern Turkey were supporters of democracy and laicist constitution, they and the country they built represent the extreme opposite of Islamists populism which negects elective governments and desire the substitution of free will in favour of central planning. 

European governments must stop trivialising secular movements in Eurasia and the Middle East, they do exist and are much underestimated. They are our true allies to whom we should show support.

In the late noughties, a teacher and hero of mine *proudly* told me that Turkey was never going to become a totalitarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the defender Atatürk's gift to the nation and that it would never let the country fall into the hands of radicals, extremists or authoritarians. I recall being taught the difference between Ottomanism and Kemalism, sharing quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussing with classmates whether Turkey should be part of the EU. I also remember vividly my amazement and appreciation for Atatürk's understanding of game theory and political brilliance when I learned that in his effort to establish gender equality and dissuade women from covering themselves he made the veil mandatory for prostitutes.

As of the 19 July 2016 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) still states that "Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage," but for how long?
