The mere possibility of having another Clintonian term strikes me as frightening given rule of William Jefferson Clinton over the nineties comprised of a miasma of filthy political initiatives, personally motivated cruise missiles srikes, numerous rape accusations, questionable donations and other malignent exertions of force in which the then-first lady was---regrettably---involved. Nothing Jeffersonian but a slice of the name; he shall therefore be referred to as "Bill" so as to amputate his name like he severed Al-Shifa from Somalia.

The Clintonian affliction is upon us once more, and though is to be inflicted through the same political scheme, it is, this time around, to come from his female complement. Triangulation is the brilliant but dishonest political strategy coined by Bill's chief political advisor Dick Morris to get him reelected in 1996, and that which is unfortunately very likely to get his complicit wife in office.

Hillary's health care plan, the brilliance of which was it's very failure, is the embodiment of triangulation and all that is morally wrong with it. In 1993 Clinton set a task force headed by his wife to devise the plan; coverage would be financed by payroll taxes and delivered through regulated competition amongst *large* health maintenance organizations. The plan brought the worst of two worlds together, centralized planning and crony capitalism; there's nothing quite like guaranteed revenue and monopoly to either faction and as such was, contrary to popular belief, supported--through large donations---by the pharmaceutical industry, doctors, insurances, and many more. 

The backlash from the smaller players who were to be priced out of the market by the plan was foreseeable---and likely foreseen---by the administration. Some healthcare providers mustered just about enough for a collective telley ad campaign denouncing Hillarycare. When the plan later fell under scrutiny, it subsequently lost support, this minute and mediocre opposing force that had dared to voice their disagreement then provided the ideal scapegoat for the Clintons. Blame could be passed onto the for-profit healthcare industry as a whole. 

It should have ended then. It didn't.

The triangulated pyramidion position allows one to shift stance towards the other end of the political spectrum (when loosing support from one faction, please the other) and, instead pass a bill far more harsh than any republican could ever hope for at the time. Bill and Hill' did not just "get away with it", they managed to appear in the guise of victims fallen to an unscrupulous pressure group in their just fight for a honorable cause, having, on the way, reaped donations from the very lobby they portrayed as evil and robbed the republicans of a political victory. Manipulative brilliance.

Democrats only owned 43 percent of Congress at the time, the bill had no chance to pass and that, they very well realised. This was also evident to Dick Morris who knew that, the President had recently been elected "against all odds" and that his already meager reputation was bound to dwindle to further depths, if the plan could not be approved then, it would never be. 

Much of that if not all, is still very much present in Hillary's Presidential candidacy. She did comb through the Republican program and stole its supportable ends while simultaneously distancing herself from her rival Bernie Sanders yet suggesting, at every opportunity, that she "is not that different from senator Sanders." Her strategy is nefarious and void of any value or principle. 

Every political issue is in fact assessed in the opinion polls, she knows which view is prevalent among the public---at the time---and takes the corresponding stance. However, with time, public opinion changes and so must her message, hence being known for "changing position." 

In the late nineties/early noughties marriage equality was scarcely supported, thus, to ride the wave of public opinion, it "made sense" for Bill to sign The Defense of Marriage Act and for Hillary to state:

> Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman.
> -- <cite>Hillary Clinton, January 2000</cite>

She eventually recapitulated this [drivel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I) in the senate four years later. It did not refrain her from dramatically change her position on the issue, and in the most feeble manner to meet in many day's march at that, with a treacherous and revisionist rainbow-colored logo and a trivial tweet posted on April 28 2015, the day the Supreme Court was to hear arguments about same-sex marriage.

> Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait.
> --<cite>Hillary Clinton, April 2015</cite>

I would have thought that the nature of such a strategy would make it unsustainable as such inconsistencies came to light, but the counted ballots as of early 2016 cast suggest it is---despite the latter flaw---still very much viable. 

There is also a feeling that she is somehow *owed* the presidency. After all, this is the logical next step in her career, everything she has done culminates in this candidacy, her life's not worth if she doesn't at least get a shot. This zeitgeist sadly paves her way to the presidency and even her illegal use of a [personal email](https://github.com/JohnCoene/rodham) server in the basement of her private home will not hamper the stratagem.
