Bernie Sanders is a man of principle who holds progressive values and defends just causes, his recent trip to the Vatican, however, says otherwise.

His image of a fair-minded individual whose candidacy is motivated not by the pursuit of a political career (unlike other candidates) but by a genuine believe in just principles such as social justice, appeals to many. Despite disagreeing with the man on almost every single issue, I thought he had that going for him: he showed intellectual integrity. This persona was shattered when he visited the Vatican.

In the first country to enact a secular constitution and amidst a democratic GOP that had managed---thus far---to avoid allusions to religion, Bernie saw wise to pay a visit to the sacerdotal-monarchical state of a religion he does not follow. Dissecting the imbroglio reveals an even more mediocre picture. The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church did not, in fact, summon the senator (he is not a member of the flock). He was however mentioned in a missive from the Academy of Social Sciences which is proudly displayed on his [website](https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-Sanders-Vatican.pdf).

This reminds us that the man is very much human and capable of discreditable political moves in bids for votes. In the end, one can only conclude that in Bernie's eyes the presidency is worth betraying principles he has been claiming to hold; honesty is a virtue we now know he possesses not.

It also hints at his deficiency in dealing with anything foreign. Bernie himself tells us that the did not think this through: "it was such an honour, I could not refuse." Yes, you could. The poor fool did not even attempt to assess whether this was compatible with the values he preaches.

But what is most irritating is Bernie's use of the Pope as an endorsement. First, this is the other way about, the Pope sought the backing of the senator in an attempt to appeal to his (young) voters. Second, it discredits your economic plan but to have it endorsed by the economically illiterate.

Bernie did in fact not comment on the Centesimus Annus to which he was invited, all his remarks concern his controversial 5-minute encounter with Pope Francis, though we can assume he repeated himself once more... ("millionaires and billionaires..."). I would much rather hear Bernie's thoughts on the Church's only recent exoneration of the Jews for the death of Jesus Christ by Pope Benedict, before which the heathen Sanders could not have been invited at all.
