Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly in relapse as the attempted coup provides Erdogan with his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

Authority is dangerously addictive to the intelectually impotent not only because it artificially raises their otherwise low confidence but also because they mistake it for genuine power. The former footballer now president of Turkey is so foolishly fond of power and disdainful of freedom that he deliberately insulted Kemalism by constructing the world's largest palace on the grounds of Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo. The fusion of power and ignorance effectively turns a presidency into a therapy.

Erdogan is now purging the country of anyone who could take the slightest amount of power away from his puny hands, starting with the greatest guardians of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers (103 generals and admirals) thereby exposing his true aim which is to tighten his hold on the country and its people. The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

At this point, it is important to understand that where Erdogan ends democracy begins and that each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the coffin of Atatürk's heritance.

Turkey has seen a sharp decline of its freedom of expression, some media outlets have been taken over by the government, others have been raided, social networks are either heavily censored or blocked in their entirety. It will take years to revert the work of Erdogan, the antithesis and demolisher of Atatürk's legacy, that is if it is even possible. The opposition is now near-inexistent as it is being wiped out and, most saddening of all, despite nationwide protests against his authoritarian regime in 2013, the crook has managed to keep the people (i.e.: the majority) on his side. 

The Turkish army is notorious for coup d'états, it has successfully deposed three heads of state since 1960 when it first did so with only 38 members. Such a poorly executed attempt seems dubious and conspiracy theories are already rampant. But it is paramount to understand the reason the failure is such a unifying force amongst the populace. After all, the current government has mostly passed policies that deliberately reduce civil liberties and the villain Erdogan has not yet grasped enough power to be feared by the people. The support for the government demonstrated in the streets of Ankara is, therefore, genuine, but why? 

Secularism is in effect nugatory once the state favours one religion over others but democracy does not ensure the keeping of such principle, neither does it contemplates the right thing will be done. It only means the majority gets what it wants, be it good or evil. If the majority of the people do not see the conflict between state religion and democracy it soon will. While secular states are not always democratic, Islamic states ultimately lead to totalitarianism. 

In the late noughties, a teacher and hero of mine *proudly* told me that Turkey was never going to become a totalitarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the defender Atatürk's gift to the nation and that it would never let the country fall into the hands of radicals, extremists or authoritarians. I recall being taught the difference between Ottomanism and Kemalism, sharing quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussing with classmates whether Turkey should be part of the EU. I also remember vividly my amazement and appreciation for Atatürk's understanding of game theory and political brilliance when I learned that in his effort to establish gender equality and dissuade women from covering themselves he made the veil mandatory for prostitutes.

I cannot help but get sick on my own shoes when I see secular governments worldwide siding with the religious and abandoning the real victims of this tragedy, the laic Turks. European governments must stop trivialising secular movements in Eurasia and the Middle East, and come to the realisation they are our true allies (look back at 1960 coup staged by military personnel with connections to the west).

As of the 19 July 2016 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) still states that "Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage," but for how long?

Snap up Turkish comrades!
