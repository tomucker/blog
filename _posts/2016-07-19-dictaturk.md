Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly in relapse as the attempted coup provides Erdogan with his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

Authority is dangerously addictive to the impotent not only because it artificially rises their otherwise low confidence but also because they mistake it for authentic approval. The former footballer now president of Turkey is foolishly fond of power and disdainful of Kemalism to such a degree he's made the deliberate and lame insult of constructing the world's largest palace on the grounds of Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo. Such conduct effectively turns a presidency into a therapy.

Erdogan is now purging the country of anyone who could take the slightest amount of power away from his puny hands, starting with the greatest guardians of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers (103 generals and admirals) thereby exposing his true aim which is to tighten his hold on the county and its people (not to punish). The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

At this point it is important to understand that where Erdogan ends democracy begins and that each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the coffin of Atatürk's heritance.

Turkey has freshly seen its freedom of expression sharply decline, some media outlets have been taken over by the government, others have been raided, social networks are either heavily censored or blocked in their entirety. It will take years to revert the work of Erdogan, the antithesis and demolisher of Atatürk's legacy, that is, if it even takes place. The opposition is now near-inexistent as it is being wiped out and, most saddening of all, despite nationwide protests against his authoritarian regime in 2013, the crook has managed to keep the people (i.e.: the majority) on his side. 

The turkish army is notorious for coup d'états, it has successfully deposed three heads of state since 1960 when it first did so with only 38 members. Such a poorly executed attempt seems dubious and conspiracy theories are already rampant. But it is more interesting to understand the reason for the failure to be such a unifying force amongst the populace. After all, the current government has mostly passed policies that deliberately reduce civil liberties and the vilian Erdogan has not yet grasped enough power to be feared by the populace. The support for his government demonstatred in the streets of Ankara is therefore genuine, but why? 

Most know why but are afraid to name it, it is undeniably because of religion. As I have expressed before in recent years secularism in Turkey has regressed to give way to a religion in particular and religion is by nature is totalitarian. It is not enough that the follower believes, others must believe in it too. Particularly in the case of Islam which takes care of every thing for you: from mariage to banking. There is indeed no such thing as Shariah law, Shariah actually means law.

How disheartening it is to see secular governments worldwide siding with the religious and abandonning the real victims of this tragedy, the secular Turkish forces and institutions (namely the Diyanet). Contrary to popular belief Turkey is *not*a Muslim state, Islam is only the most represented religion in a secular state. The Ottoman caliphate has been abolished for now 93 years and the country has been a democracy ever since. 

In the late noughties, a teacher and hero of mine *proudly* told me that Turkey was never going to become a totalitarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the defender Atatürk's gift to the nation and that it would never let the country fall into the hands of radicals, extremists or authoritarians. I recall being taught the difference between Ottomanism and Kemalism, sharing quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussing with classmates whether Turkey should be part of the EU. I also remember vividly my amazement and appreciation for Atatürk's understanding of game theory and political brilliance when I learned that in his effort to establish gender equality and dissuade women from covering themselves he made the veil mandatory for prostitutes.

As of the 19 July 2016 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) still states that "Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage," but for how long?

Snap up Turkish comrades!
