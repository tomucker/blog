Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly in relapse as the attempted coup provides Erdogan with his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

Authority is dangerously addictive to the impotent not only because it artificially rises their otherwise low confidence but also because they mistake it for authentic power. The former footballer now president of Turkey is foolishly fond of executive power and disdainful of Kemalism to such a degree he's had the world's largest palace constructed on the grounds of Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo, a deliberate and lame insult. Such conduct effectively turns a presidency into a therapy.

Erdogan is now purging the entire country of anyone who could take the slightest amount of power away from his puny hands, starting with the greatest guardians of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers (103 generals and admirals) thereby exposing his true aim which is to tighten his hold on the county and its people. The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

At this point it is important to understand that in Turkey where Erdogan ends democracy begins and that each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the coffin of Atatürk's heritance.

Turkey has freshly seen its freedom of expression sharply decline, some media outlets have been taken over by the government others have been raided, social networks are either heavily censored or blocked entirely. It will take years to revert the work of Erdogan, the antithesis and demolisher of Atatürk's legacy, that is, if it even takes place. The opposition is now near-inexistent as it is currently being wiped away and, most saddening of all, despite nationwide protests against his authoritarian regime in 2013, the crook has managed to keep the people (majority) on his side. 

In the late noughties, a teacher and hero of mine proudly told me that Turkey was never going to become a totalitarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the defender Atatürk's gift to the nation and that it would never let the country fall into the hands of radicals, extremists or authoritarians. I recall being taught the difference between Ottomanism and Kemalism, sharing quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussing with classmates whether Turkey should be part of the EU. I also remember vividly my amazement and appreciation for Atatürk's understanding of game theory and political brilliance when I learned that in his effort to establish gender equality and dissuade women from covering themselves he made the veil mandatory for prostitutes.

As of the 19 July 2016 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) still states that "Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage," but for how long?

Rise up Turkish comrades!
