Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly bound to relapse decades as the attempted coup provides Erdogan with his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

The former semi-professional footballer now president of Turkey is foolishly fond of executive power and disdainful of Kemalism to such a degree he had the world's largest palace constructed on the grounds of Atat端rk Forest Farm and Zoo. Authority is dangerously addictive to the impotent not only because they mistake it for power but also because it swells their otherwise low confidence. Such maniacal behaviour turns the presidency into a therapy at the cost of millions.

Erdogan is now purging the entire country of anyone who could take the slightest amount of power away from his little puny hands, starting with the greatest guardians of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers: 103 generals and admirals. The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

It is important to understand that in Turkey where Erdogan ends democracy begins and that each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the country's coffin.

Turkey has freshly seen its freedom of expression and other liberties sharply decline, some media outlets have been taken over by the government others have been raided, social networks are either censored or blocked. It will take years to revert work of Erdogan, the antithesis and demolisher of Atat端rk's legacy, that is if it even takes place. The opposition is now inexistent or currently being wiped away and most saddening, despite nationwide protests against his authoritarian regime in 2013, Erdogan has managed to keep the majority on his side. It is all too reminiscent of Burke vs Paine. Either the people of Turkey are under a great misapprehension with regard to their current President and his agenda or Edmund Burke was right all along, the people do not have the fortitude to support the practical assertion of the rights they claimed and now "take up arms to maintain they have *not* rights." 

In the late noughties, a teacher and hero of mine proudly taught my classmates and me that Turkey was never going to become a totalitarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the defender the legacy of Atat端rk and that it would never let the country fall into the hands of radicals, extremists or authoritarians. I remember vividly learning about Ottomanism and Kemalism, sharing quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussing whether Turkey should be part of the EU. Please, Turkish comrades, do not let us be wrong!

As of the 19 July 2016 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) still states that "Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage," but for how long?
