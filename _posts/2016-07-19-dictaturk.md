Democracy and secularism in Turkey are sadly bound to backslide decades as the attempted coup provides Erdogan his best opportunity yet to consolidate power. 

The former semi-professional footballer now president of Turkey is foolishly fond of executive power and disdainful of Kemalism to such a degree he had the world's largest palace constructed on the grounds of Atat端rk Forest Farm and Zoo. Authority is dangerously addictive to the impotent not only because they mistake it for power but also because it swells their otherwise low confidence. Such maniacal behaviour turns the presidency into a therapy at the cost of millions.

Erdogan is now purging the entire country of anyone who could take even the slightest amount of power away from his little hands, starting with the greatest defenders of secular values in the region, the Turkish army. Nearly 3'000 military personnel have been dismissed, of which a disproportionally large number of high ranking officers: 103 generals and admirals. The government also sacked a fifth of the judiciary, 2'745 of its members and is detaining 755 judges.

It is important to understand that in Turkey where Erdogan ends democracy begins, each and every opponent he removes is another nail in the country's coffin.

The country has already seen its freedom of expression and other liberties sharply decline, some media outlets have been taken over by the government others have been raided, social networks are either censored or blocked. It will take years to revert work of Erdogan, the antithesis and demolisher of Atat端rk and his legacy, that is if it even takes place. The opposition is now inexistent or currently being wiped away and most saddening, despite nationwide protests against his authoritarian regime in 2013, Erdogan has managed to keep the majority on his side, it is all too reminiscent of Burke vs Paine. Either the people of Turkey are under a great misapprehension with regard to their current President and his agenda or Edmund Burke was right all along, the people do not have the fortitude to support the practical assertion of the rights they claimed and now "take up arms to maintain they have *not* rights." 

I find the events of the past few days heartbreaking. Turkey was an example of  progressive and democratic yet Islamic state, it was going in the right direction and destined for great things. It is distressing that Erdogan finds supports locally and internationally. 

One of my teachers and hero of mine proudly taught me and my classmates that Turkey was, unlike popular beliefs at the time, never going to become an authoritarian Islamic state, that the Turkish army was the guardian of secularism and the legacy of Atat端rk and that it would never let such a regime take power. I remember it very well, this was in the late noughties, we learned about Ottomanism and Kemalism, shared quotes by the Father of the Turks, and discussed whether it should access the EU. Please Turkish comrades do not let us be wrong.
