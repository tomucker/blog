Responses to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union both therein and thereout the country have been pathetic.

While it appears true that the Vote Leave camp found support mainly from the less educated who did not understand the implications of Brexit the corollary stands too, members of the opposite faction, though admittedly more literate, were utterly unable to compute the actual benefits of the membership to the union, let alone vocalise it. This was particularly true of the latter which would merely use the terms open borders, diversity, trade, etc. as synonyms for "good" and never produced an acceptable balance sheet of the exchanges between the EU and the UK.

Mainstream politicians greatly underestimated the Brexit movement and put together a rather poor case. The most flagrant illustration of this must be the debate on sovereignty in which the Remain camp simply did not engage. The European Union is not a mere threat to the sovereignty of its member states, it openly aims to replace it with supranational institutions and hopes to eventually found the United States of Europe. Instead of acknowledging to the latter and argue in favour of it Remainers never turned up at the round-table.

The country's applications in 1963 and 1967 were both vetoed by Charles de Gaulle on the grounds that Britain was "incompatible with Europe", it was never truly welcome. The UK was finally *allowed to* join in 1973, a whole decade after its first plea, and they were met by an already well-acquainted group of nations who, it must be said, perceived them as insincere supporters of their pet project and thus not trustworthy.

When I read that "[Britain needs the EU](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/opinion/boris-johnson-britain-europe-brexit.html?_r=0)" or that "[Britain can't stand aside from Europe](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3543962/History-teaches-T-stand-aside-Europe-Wellington-Churchill-yes-Lady-Thatcher-confirm.html)" (as if these consisted of arguments on their own) I like to remind people that this was manifestly nor mutual nor reciprocal and that members states were often more suspicious of Britain than Britain was critical of the union. The EU did not give much significance to the membership of the United Kingdom which *could not* veto as much as 80% of EU law and decisions. 

The truth is that the European Union rejected Britain far too often and for far too long and consequently built a union the British could simply not consent to in the strict sense. The EU is built upon French models and their bureaucracy under a German leadership. Was Britain let in earlier the European Union would look much different and it would play a key role within it. Tony Blair perhaps takes it a step too far but he sures hints at the issue.

The United Kingdom along with many other European citizens including myself are actually in favour of a united Europe but certainly not the one that has been established. One can only admit that the European Union has very little traces of democracy. One can only recognise that the union is not under enough scrutiny, it is rarely, if ever, properly criticised in the French or German press. One must comprehend the significance of ignoring the voice of the people to ratify theTreaty of Lisbon. One can but feel contempt at the debt crisis and the bailout of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus. 

The European Union which centralises the power of 28 sovereign nations is void of self-limiting principles and has the extent of its power constantly widened, thus far only the British have dared question the possible outcomes of such an organisation.
