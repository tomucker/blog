Discussions surrounding the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU both therein and thereout the country have been pathetic at best.

While it appears true that the Vote Leave camp found support mainly from the less educated who did not understand the implications of Brexit the corollary stands too, partisans of the opposite faction, though admittedly more literate, were altogether unable to compute the actual benefits of the membership to the union, let alone vocalise it. This was particularly true of the latter which would just use the terms open borders, diversity, togetherness, etc. as synonyms for "good" and never produced an acceptable balance sheet of the exchanges between the EU and the UK.

Mainstream politicians greatly underestimated the Brexit movement and put together a rather poor case. The most flagrant illustration of this must be the debate on sovereignty in which the Remain camp simply did not engage. To say that the European Union is a mere threat to the sovereignty of its member states is an understatement. It openly aims to replace it with supranational institutions to eventually found the United States of Europe. Instead of acknowledging to the latter and argue in favour of it, Remainers never turned up at the round-table.

The country's applications in 1963 and 1967 were both vetoed by Charles de Gaulle on the grounds that Britain was "incompatible with Europe." And when the British were finally *allowed to* join in 1973, a whole decade after their first plea, they were met by an already well-acquainted group of nations who perceived them as insincere supporters of their pet project.

Carry this in mind when you read that "[Britain needs the EU](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/opinion/boris-johnson-britain-europe-brexit.html?_r=0)" or that "[Britain can't stand aside from Europe](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3543962/History-teaches-T-stand-aside-Europe-Wellington-Churchill-yes-Lady-Thatcher-confirm.html)" (as if these consisted of arguments on their own) because it is (if true at all) manifestly nor mutual nor reciprocal, and that member states were often more suspicious of Britain than Britain was critical of the union. 

The European Union rejected Britain far too often and for far too long and consequently built a union the British could not properly consent to; the EU is found on uncompromising German models and convoluted French bureaucracy that are conflicting with the British political system. Were the British let in earlier, the European Union would look much different and they would play a key role within it. Tony Blair perhaps takes it a step too far, but certainly, hints at the issue.

The United Kingdom along with many other European citizens including myself are actually in favour of a united Europe, just not the one that has been established. 

One can only admit that the European Union has very little traces of democracy. One should recognise that the union is not under enough scrutiny, that it is rarely, if ever, criticised in any of the Inner Six. One must feel contempt to see his or her voice ignored and a scheming treaty ratified. One can but feel bitter of the debt crisis and the bailout of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus. The latter remarks are far more absurd than the UK leaving a union it was only partially in. 

Brexit is unlikely to have the domino effect some say it may trigger. But It is probably true that the debate which occurred in the UK, were it to take place in other member states would result in the same outcome, not because "the people are stupid" but because a thoroughly investigated EU is a tough sell. This does not vindicate the lies told by the likes of Nigel Farage but merely indicates that there are sensible, concrete arguments against a membership of the EU, which justify an important debate that is yet to be had.
